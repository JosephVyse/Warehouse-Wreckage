# Warehouse Wreckage
 First game using unreal engine & blueprint.

 What I have learned:
  - Blueprint basics: nodes, pins
  - Programming basics: variables, strings, references, functions
  - Unreal basics: maps, actors, components, transforms, vectors
  - Object Oriented basic: objects/structs, classes, member functions
